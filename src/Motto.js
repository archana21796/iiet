            <p className='p-0 m-0'>Creating a new generation of self-actualized learners is our
                 raison d'etre. If children are our future, then education is 
                 the key to their future. When education is shaped around them, and not
                  the other way around, we are laying the foundation for a future/world where creativity, 
                  diversity and caring, independent-thinkers thrive with courage and conviction. Our curriculum thrives on continuous 
                  learning while interacting with and incorporating real-world situations and challenges. Imagine a world led by those
                   who dare to care, innovate, and dream big that’s the future we’re building - World Changers, one student at a time since 1951. </p>
